# ffplayout-engine

At the moment this is only a placeholder.

In the future the ffplayout-engine will be a replacement of https://github.com/jb-alvarado/ffplayout.

The plane is, to replace the external buffer with a python solution and replace the ffmpeg executable with PyAV [ffplayout-gui](https://github.com/mikeboers/PyAV).
