# ffplayout-engine

At the moment this is only a placeholder.

The ffplayout-engine will be a replacement of https://github.com/jb-alvarado/ffplayout in the future.

The plane is, to replace the external buffer with a python solution and replace the ffmpeg executable with PyAV (https://github.com/jb-alvarado/ffplayout).
